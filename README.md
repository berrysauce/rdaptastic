rdaptastic is a modern lookup tool that uses the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP), the successor to WHOIS. It provides a clean summary of a domain's registry information, tracks historical changes, and can notify you of updates when something changes.

## üåê How does it work?

RDAPtastic leverages the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) to fetch detailed information about a domain, such as:

- Registrar details
- Domain age
- Nameservers
- Other critical information

RDAP is the modern replacement for the widely used WHOIS protocol, offering a more structured and standardized way to access domain data.

In addition to querying domain registries via RDAP, this tool integrates:

- ICANN's RDAP database to identify the appropriate RDAP service for each TLD.
- Cloudflare DNS and IPInfo APIs for ASN lookups and related data.

### Objective
The goal of rdaptastic is to not only perform RDAP lookups but also to organize and present the data in a user-friendly way. The result is a comprehensive overview of a domain's health, status, and other relevant metrics.

## üõ† How Does It Work?

rdaptastic is composed of two main components:

`rdaptastic/web`
The web-based frontend, built with SvelteKit (5+).

`rdaptastic/api`
The API backend, built with the lightweight Hono framework.

### Hosting and Security
Both components are currently hosted using Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare Workers. For added security, Cloudflare Turnstile is employed to protect against abuse.
